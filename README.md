# Read Me
This repository is the home for my Computational Thinking for Government Analytics. Much of the information contained is data used in my project, which is on ballot measures in Washington.

## Exec
The exec file is a synopsis of relevant findings. Please use Jupyter NB Viewer for full functionality.

## Master
The master contains more analysis of the data as well as more documentation of how the code works.

## Other Files
the other files are data used in the code including shape files, which will have to be downloaded onto your hard drive to edit as Geopandas could not communicate with GitHub.

Enjoy!
